# DupeFinder
A console tool to **detect duplicate files** and consolidate them using **NTFS hardlinks. It scans a target directory, groups files with identical content, and replaces duplicates with hardlinks pointing to a chosen master file. This saves disk space while preserving filenames, paths, and timestamps.
